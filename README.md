## Draw without switching between hundreds of sprites

**This project is at planning stage**. I can't really code, so if anybody could help with that I'd really appreciate it. <br>
Basic idea: you have a texture atlas with all the Minecraft blocks, edit it however you want and run the program. The atlas is cut into individual textures renamed accordingly. 

Additional files would (could) be "settings.cfg" file to set the texture size, input/output paths for the image(s), maximum amount of sprites before aborting and "names.txt" (or .csv) file to get the texture names from. 

There is a [**project**](https://github.com/Clashsoft/Texture-Separator) I'm currently using in pair with bat-script for renaming, but naming files accordingly right away would make it better. 

Please contact me via [Telegram](tg://resolve?domain=temhotaokeaha) or drop an issue here if you're able to help with the coding part.
